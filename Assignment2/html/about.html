          In the heart of Invercargill, a small slice of Asia has found its
          home. Our lodge and grocery store is a labor of love, a place where
          the warmth of Asian cultures mingles with the rich flavors of the many
          homelands we represent. We invite you to be a part of our journey, as
          we've been sharing the diverse tastes of Asia with our community for
          several years now.

        <div class="text-wrapper-4">A Growing Legacy</div>
        <p class="text-wrapper-5">
          Over the years, our lodge and grocery store have grown and evolved,
          just like the diverse Asian community we are proud to serve in
          Invercargill. We've become a beloved gathering place for Asians from
          various backgrounds, offering a wide range of familiar ingredients
          from across Asia, and providing a warm space to connect with friends
          and neighbors who share a love for their unique cultures. At the heart
          of our story is our unwavering commitment to you, our valued customers
          and guests. We're not just a business; we're a part of your lives,
          sharing in your experiences, and supporting you on your journey. As we
          reflect on our time in Invercargill, we are excited for the future and
          the opportunities it holds to continue serving this vibrant community
          with the rich flavors and traditions of Asia, and with the warmth of
          Asian hospitality. Thank you for being a part of our journey. We look
          forward to what the next chapter will bring!
